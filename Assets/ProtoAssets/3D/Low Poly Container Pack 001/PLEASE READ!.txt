Hello! 

This has been included to tell you what you need to know about this asset pack. Please read it thoroughly so you are informed.


HOW TO USE THE ASSETS
--------------------------------------
You can import these assets into your favourite engine(s) capable of loading 3D assets. There are three file formats you can choose from:

.blend: Files created using free 3D modelling software called Blender. Some engines support .blend files but you can easily load the desired assets of choice and export them to your preferred file format. .blend files can also be edit using the tools in Blender to suit your creative needs.

.obj: Universally used for game engines that use 3D graphics.

NOTE: I decided not to convert these models into an fbx format since obj is much more universal. To create fbx versions of these assets you can open up the blend files and export them to fbx manually if you want to. I should also mention that I only created .fbx versions of the three boxes; I did this because the .fbx versions' lids can be taken off, adjusted or removed. If you want to be able to adjust the lids please use the .fbx boxes!
